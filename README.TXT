=== Save Directory

This directory keeps all your save files.  There is one save file for
each character in the game, which keeps ALL stats and equipment for that
character.  They are all independent of each other.  You can rename them,
copy them, delete them, back up and restore them, whatever you want,
with no problems.  No more pcobjs.obj and players files!
