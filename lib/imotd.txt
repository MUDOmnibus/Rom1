Welcome Immortal!

Remember, ROM gods are held to higher standards than mortals are.

You may not:
*offer undue assistance to mortals
*give free objects to players
*aid your own mortal characters -- in ANY way
*kill players
*transport mobiles into midgaard
*load items without good reason
*anything else that even SEEMS wrong

Initiations are no longer permitted -- don't kill mortals OR gods

Please post all freezes on the freeze board at death.

God rooms are at 1200-1202, 1499, 6903, and 9803-9805.  More are being added.

The new skill system on ROM II is up, so it is time to hand out the levels.
Contact me on ROM II, and show me your character on ROM I.  These levels are
NOT additive, so I recommend starting a new character on ROM II so you can
play the new skills.

Level 31: 15th level 32: 20th level 33: 25th
