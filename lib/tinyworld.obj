A set of rules, governing the behavior of immortals has been dropped here.~
              Rules for Immortal Player Behaviour

Upon becoming immortal, you are no longer considered a player in DikuMud,
you simply cannot get killed. Therefore, there are certain rules you must
follow. Knowingly breaking these rules will probably cost you your
characters(s).

 - An immortal must not support ANY mortal playing character in the game,
   including his/her own caracter. Supporting includes grouping, items,
   money, 'preparing' monsters for easy killing, etc.
      You may occasionally help low-level players by giving them
   small amounts of money or items. You may only give them what is
   buyable in the shops, and never more than 500 gold coins worth.
      Immortals are welcome to take part in the game, by creating
   unexpected (but never unreasonably harmful) obstacles for the players,
   or by providing divine assistance to a newcomer in distress. Usage
   of the 'switch'-command to make the monsters more challenging or
   entertaining is also acceptable - see the rules about harming players,
   below.

 - An immortal is allowed to play other characters, provided that he/she
   does not support them - see above. Beware: It is very hard not to help
   your mortal player, and we'll show virtually no mercy, should we find out.
     Exception from this rule can be made ONLY for test purposes, and only
   by immortals who are actually building or supervising areas of the
   world. Other players should NEVER benefit or suffer from this.
   Test characters should not be a nuisance to other players in any way.

 - An immortal character is not allowed to harm mortal players
   in any way, unless this player is extremly provocative and
   annoying to others.

   Any action taken against mortals should have a VERY good reason.

 - Implementors of DikuMUD reserves right to change any of the
   above rules.

 - A frequently asked question is what to do after a game crash. In general,
   you shouldn't do anything. However, if you feel up to it, and if you
   feel very confident that you aren't being cheated (grabbed by the nose,
   as they say in Denmark), you are allowed to make compensations for the
   losses of the players. Still, the rule in this case is, 'better too
   little than too much'.

"Any excuse is a bad excuse" - Papi

These are just suggestions:

 - You could hang around talking to other players.

 - You may apply for building a new area in the world of DikuMud.
   Send a letter to the Central Commitee of DikuMud Building Junta
   Association. This may be sent to either:
	Kahn (c60b-1gb@widow.berkeley.edu)
	Hatchet (mitchell@ocf.berkeley.edu)
   We will then return a letter explaining the Building rules.

 - You may apply for World Supervisor. A supervisor is
   assigned an area(s) which other immortals are building. The idea
   is that you test the area, give ideas for changes, inform the
   creator of rare items which are too easy to obtain. Etc.
   The Supervisor is "higher rank" than the creator, and can always send
   a letter to the Central Commitee of DikuMud Building Junta Association
   in cases of disagreement with the creator.
   This is a highly trusted position, and you will have to prove worthy
   somehow.
   For more information send a letter asking for more rules.

  This note seems of utmost importance, as it has the stamp of the

        To Anyone,
        I have lost my birth control pills, and I will reward anyone who
        finds them.  Without them I will have many unwanted children.
        You should be able to find the keys (YES, KEYS) to the castle,
        since none of my servants fight for anything anymore, and one
        of them should be around the store room, where I lost it, so
        examine the area CAREFULLY since the dust is very thick there.
        But who cares about fighting?  I'm a lover, not a fighter.
        The last time I saw the other key was on a barrack dwarf.
  Signed, The Queen.
  PS When you find them, tell the Gods, and he will reward your hard
     work.  You must have all the keys necessary to obtain it, also.

   DO NOT ask a god.  There is a quest involved within here, and your
   first hint is that a dwarf in the barracks is your first clue.  He
   is not willing to share in the prize, so you may have to kill him
   for it.  When you complete the quest, you will be richly rewarded!
   Don't think that it is easy, because it is NOT.  Contact Depeche
   when you have finished the quest, or leave a message on the board.

The Olympian blade is a stunning work of craftsmanship, obviously

weapon is almost too good to be in the hands of a mere mortal.
Perhaps it would be wise to return it to the appropriate deity.

It is 10 X 15 X 2", and quite regular. It is transparent, and, while 
probably not glass, it still feels like glass. There are a large number 
of tiny, needlethin blue lines inside it, and a 1 X 1" square red

It is a wonderful Boris Vallejo painting of a husky barbarian and a
scantily-clad lady, with large letters saying:

"            	looking for a
			GOOD TIME?"

and at the bottom:

"	NEW & EXCITING Attration, Right Here:
		The MAZE, with:

		* Mountains & Valleys *
		* Tunnels & Trolls    *
		* Danger & Adventure  *

			presented to You by
				the DRAGON   "

Pasted across it is a white paper with atrocious purple letters,
obstructing the view of the better parts.

It is annoying, since you can't see the _good_ parts of the Vallejo
poster, but it seems to be glued on pretty solid.
