OK, you asked for the bug/idea file, so here goes :)

My own ideas:
(which I plan to implement myself)

More classes instead of multiclassing
giants, elves, dwarves, and humans as races
A few new skills, including some martial arts for a few classes
A fight routine that allows anyone to be attacked, along with party
ordering.

That is about all.
