#

Most equipment you may have gathered is saved (keys are a notable
exception).
#
STRING
For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters. The
format is:

string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.
Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):
Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at. For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.
#
LOAD
For loading new objects or characters from the database.  The format is:
load <type> <number> (object level)
Where <type> is either 'obj' or 'char', and number is the number of the object
or character you wish to create.

The object level argument specifies the level the object will be created at.
In reimburses, make it the character's level if you are uncertain of the proper
level, and be VERY cautious about creating level 0 gear.  

Load defaults to your level if you don't provide an argument, you can use this
to outfit yourself with divine equipment that can not be used by others.
#
INVENTORY

that no thieves have gotten to your backpack.

#
SAY TELL GTELL SHOUT WHISPER ASK
Communicate with other beings.  SAY says something to everyone in the
room.  The quote char ' is a synonym for say.  TELL tells something to
another character, no matter where that character is.  GTELL tells
something to every character in your group, even if they are separated
from you.  The semicolon ; is a synonym for gtell.  SHOUT shouts
something to every character in the game.  SHOUT costs 10 mv to use.
Excessive use of shouting annoys other people and may get your SHOUT
ability turned off.

WHISPER and ASK are still more communication commands ... figure them
out yourself.

Examples:
	shout Anyone want to group?  Meet at fountain.
	tell Furey I just found a bug.
	gtell RECALL NOW!
	; RECALL NOW!
	say So do you play Merc a lot?
	' So do you play Merc a lot?
#
SOCIAL EMOTE POSE SMILE CACKLE GRIN BOW SHAKE BOUNCE KISS SLAP LAUGH
There are about a hundred social commands.  These are used to express
your mood to other players, but don't do anything in terms of game
mechanics.  You can use EMOTE to show your own custom emotions.

If you want a new social command, use the IDEA command to tell us about it,
and we can add it.

Example:
	shake Hatchet
	emote holds his breath and turns blue!
#
KILL HIT
A good way to start a fight.  To prevent you from accidentally killing
your fellow players, you must type MURDER to do so.  Killing other players
will result in your receiving a (KILLER) flag and having various and sundry
nasties done to you.

See also:  MURDER
#
MURDER
This is the command you must use to kill a player, though NOT recommended.
You may kill a player that has a THIEF and/or KILLER flag without
worrying about the consequences.

See also:  KILL HIT
#
KICK
Fighters only.

The success of a kick depends upon how well you are learned.  The higher
level you reach the harder you kick.  There is one small catch - whenever
you kick (or miss) you will be unable to type any command for three 
rounds of 'Violence' - so be sure that you do not need to flee!

Fighters See Also : Rescue, Bash, Disarm
#
BASH
Fighters only.

The success of a bash depends upon how well you are learned.  To bash someone
is to attempt to 'knock' that person over. If you succeed you will inflict
minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on it's rear.  The victim will be
unable to issue any commands for 2 rounds of violence.  If you miss you lose
your balance and fall.

A bash makes you unable to type commands for 2 rounds of violence.

Note that hitting a person who is resting/sitting will inflict 1.5 * damage.

Fighters See Also : Rescue, Kick, Disarm
#
RESCUE
Fighters Only.

A rescue is an attempt to make a monster hit you instead of the person being
rescued.  You can only 'turn' one monster for each attempt. This is highly
usable when playing in groups.
#
STEAL

Thief Only.

Use steal to steal gold or items from people. The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practised steal, and if the person
is asleep.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it is now impossible to steal from other 
players. You can steal from all monsters, except shopkeepers.
Furthermore steal takes time to perform. you can't just
rush in, steal 20-30 times and quit (unless you have a LOT of time).

Example:

> steal gold drunk

> steal sword mercenary
  (only possible if he is sleeping)

NOTE:  If you choose to steal from a Player, be forewarned, you WILL
be punished. 
#
BACKSTAB

Thief only.

Is a way to sneak up on a person, and attempt to place you dagger in his
back, at exactly the point where it does most damage. A successful backstab
gives a damage multiplier, depending on level. It also uses up your next two 
rounds of fighting.

The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well you
have practised backstab at your guild. You can always backstab sleeping
persons.

You cannot backstab a wounded mobile for obvious reasons -- NO one is going
to be caught off guard if he/she/it is wounded.  Most likely the monster is
going to be cowering in a corner waiting to heal up. 
#
DISARM

Thief and Warrior only.

The chance of a disarm depends upon how well you are learned.  To disarm
someone is to attempt to 'knock' away that person's weapon.  If you
succeed you will cause him to drop his weapon onto the ground.  If you
miss, your opponent will be able to attack one extra round.

A disarm makes you unable to type commands for 3 rounds of violence for
a success, 2 rounds of violence without.

A character without a weapon will do less damage and will be unable to
parry.
#
TRIP

Thief only.

The chance of a trip depends upon how well you are learned.  To trip
someone is to attempt to 'knock' a person down.  If you succeed you will
cause him to fall down onto the ground causing 1 point of damage.

A successful trip will cause you to be unable to type commands for 2
rounds of violence, and cause your victim to be unable to type commands
for 3 rounds of violence and sit down.
#
DODGE

Thief only.

The chance of dodging an attack depends upon how well you are learned.
If you succeed, you would have skillfully dodged your opponent's attack.

#
PARRY

Warrior only.

The chance of parrying an attack depends upon how well you are learned.
If you succeed, you would have parried your opponent's attack.

Note:  You must have a weapon wielded to be able to parry.
#
DUAL

Warrior and Thieves only.

This skill imparts the ability to attack once more than your primary attack.
Highly usefull while in combat.  :)

With _just_ the skill DUAL, you can get a maximum of 2 attacks.

See Also:  Multiattack
#
MULTIATTACK

Warrior and Thieves only.

This skill imparts the ability to attack once more than your primary attack.

See Also:  Dual
#

  > help cure light
  > help ventriloquate
  > help energy drain
#
DROP
If you lose interest in a carried item, you can drop it on the ground.
Example : drop bottle
  If you feel like getting rid of all your earthly possessions, you may use
"drop all".

See also: GET, TAP
#
PURGE
A way to make the world a little cleaner.
Usage:
  purge                         To empty a room of monsters and objects.
  purge <character>             To remove a living thing. Kicks out a player.
  purge <object>                Figure this one out yourself.
#
STAT

skills, strength, mana, hitpoints etc.

'Stat room' will give you useful information about the room you're in.
#
ORDER
You can order mobiles under your charm to do things:

   order drunk say I'm a jerk and I know it.

Or you can order all the people who're charmed by you, like this:

   order followers say We worship you, leader!!
#
LIST BUY SELL VALUE
LIST tells you what a shop has for sale.
BUY buys things by name.
SELL sells items you have to the shopkeeper for gold.
VALUE tells you how much a shopkeeper will pay for an item.
#
RENT SAVE QUIT
MERC doesn't have rent.  Just save and quit, anywhere.  If you are in town,
you will come back where you left.  If you are out of town, you will still
come back where you left, and you will lose some experience points as well.
This keeps you from getting free recalls back to town.

All your stuff will be saved when you quit.  (In fact, quit automatically
does a save, so saving first is redundant).

There is now no need to kill your link instead of quitting.  In fact,
link dying will be harsher on your character than using quit.
#
WEATHER
If you're uncertain whether the sun is shining or the rain is pouring down.
#
READ
When you want to read something.  For reading scrolls, use RECITE.
#
REMOVE
If you tire of wearing some armor or wielding a weapon.
Example : remove sword
#
SHOPS
Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

    20	5
    23	6
    25  7	

See also: TRAIN
#
TRAIN

You can use your practices to increase your ability points.  First,
find a trainer (there are two in Midgaard).  Then, type TRAIN STR
to increase your strength, or TRAIN WIS for wisdom.  The trainable
abilities are STR, INT, WIS, CON, DEX, HITS, and MANA.  Stats are 
raised by one point for 5 or 3 practices (depending on class), Hit
points and Mana are increased by 2 points per practice. 
#
EXITS
Gives you a list of the obvious exits from your location. Of course, the less
obvious ones won't show up here - you have to THINK in order to locate those.
#
LEAVE
If you feel claustrophobic, typing 'leave' will make you use the nearest
obvious exit to the outside.
#
ENTER
If you type 'enter' while you are outdoors, you'll enter any nearby shelter.
You can also follow 'enter' with an argument; for example, 'enter window'.
#
TIME
Gives you the current 'gametime'. Your initial reaction to the output of this
command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it. You'll have to, at
any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this particular notion
of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.
#
BUG TYPO IDEA
For making useful suggestions to the implementors.

Examples:
    bug the entire game crashes when I type 'put bag in bag'
    idea make a restaurant in Midgaard
    typo 'sence' should be spelled 'sense'

the pen", whereupon you'll be asked to type in your note at the keyboard.
#
NEWS
This command will show you the current edition of "the DikuMUD Herald", a
publication dedicated to news and useful information about this world. It's a
very good idea to check it out once in a while.
#
SLEEPING WAKE REST SIT STAND
For changing your position. If you feel weary, it's probably a good idea to sit
and rest for awhile; or maybe even take a nap.
#
POUR
If you want to pour some liquid from one container to another.
#
GRAB HOLD
For getting a good grip on something; a torch, for example.

See also: WEAR, WIELD, REMOVE
#
FOLLOW NOFOLLOW
For following someone around.  Example: "follow joe".  When you are through
following, use "follow <your name>" to follow yourself.

NOFOLLOW prevents people from following you, this is very useful when someone
is trying to annoy you.

See also: GROUP
#
FLEE
If you're in a fight and losing, then FLEE.
#
IMPLEMENTOR IMMORTAL
The implementors are Hatchet, Kahn, and Furey.  It is through our hundreds
of hours of work that you can enjoy MERC Diku Mud.  Our e-mail address is
mec@garnet.berkeley.edu.

The Chief Immortal is Hatchet, and the other Immortals are Jordan and Frag.

If you have a problem with the game, implementors and immortals are there
to help you.

If an implementor or an immortal asks you to do something, then do it.
If they ask you how something happened, then tell them.  As a player in
our mud, you are a guest at the party we are throwing.  If you hassle us,
we'll kick you out.

On the other side ... if an immortal interferes with game balance, or uses
immortal power to harrass players, we (the implementors or chief immortal)
will demote as needed.  An immortal is not a superman mortal.  They are
there to help run the game, not for their own personal enjoyment.

Two of the implementors, and most of the immortals, also have mortal
characters.  Feel free to treat these as you would any other players.
They don't get any special benefits for their mortal chars, and you don't
owe them any more than you do other mortal chars.
#
GUILD
The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and
perils of a cruel world.  Each guild is heavily guarded, so that only members
may enter the building.  Guilds are also the places where people come to
learn and practise the skills of their trade.

See also: PRACTISE
#
INFO
Gives you some useful hints and information about the game.
#
WHERE
Tells you the location of a monster, a player or an object. Examples:

where torch
where dragon

Mortals can only "where" monsters or players, and only from their own
zone.  Mortals may type 'where' without arguments to see where visible
players are in their zone.

Immortals may type 'where' without arguments to see where everybody is.
#
LEVELS

Lists the levels of your class. 
#
BRIEF
Toggle "brief mode".  When in brief mode, you don't see the descriptions of the
room you are in; only the name of the room, and the people and objects in
there.  Unless you are very familiar with the area in which you travel, however,
it is not advisable to use this command.  Frequently, you will find small, but
vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your
surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!

See also: COMPACT
#
!
Repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.
#
CONSIDER
Usage : consider <monster>
This command will compare your level with the <monsters> level. You will then
receive a rough estimate, which is by no means exact. Consider does not take
hitpoints/special attacks/damage into accout.

Example:
  > consider fido
#
EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you inflict damage on a monster, you earn experience points.
You get lots more when you kill it.  When you get enough xp, you raise
a level.

You lose xp by dying or by quitting when not in town.  You also may
lose xp by fleeing in combat.

See Also: GROUP
#
GROUP
Usage : GROUP [player]

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped,
and their current status.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wish to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"
Dragon  : "group redferne"
Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon gets upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

#
QUAFF POTION POTIONS

Use : Quaff <Potion>

Quaff is used to "drink" a (magical) potion.
#
SCROLL SCROLLS

Use:  Scroll <number>

This command sets up your page buffer (used for who and help, for example)

larger terminal sessions should change it.


For information on USING scrolls, try 'help recite'
#
RECITE

Use : Recite <Scroll> [Target]

Is used to "read" a magical scroll. Target can be an object, character or
nothing (which may be yourself).
#
USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

Use : Use <Staff>
      Use <Wand> <Target>

Using staffs will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, except yourself. Therefore staff's are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands requires that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staff's and wand's must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands).  You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

Many objects behave like wands or staves without looking like them.
For instance, check out the vandal's spray can!
#
ARMOR

Usage       : cast 'armor' <victim>
Accumulative: No
Duration    : 24 Hours

TELEPORT

Usage       : cast 'teleport' [self]
Accumulative: -
Duration    : Instant

ADVANCE
To advance a player to a level higher or lower than his present.

NOSHOUT NOEMOTE NOCHANNEL NOTELL


These are all commands used by gods for dealing with jerks.

NOSHOUT:   prevents shouting
NOEMOTE:   prevents emotes and socials
NOCHANNEL: prevents use of channels
NOTELL:    prevents telling

This is preferable to a ban or a freeze, in most cases.
#
RESTORE
If used on a mortal, this command will reset that players mana and hit points.
If used on an immortal, various values will be reset to their proper values.
#
LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This could
hurt you in combat. But we have worked out a solution. There are two cases:

  I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
     time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
     will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
     reconnect to the game.

 II. If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem.  The only solution we
     can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
     breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

Some people like to break their link instead of quitting.  We have changed
link death and quitting so that breaking the link will cost you more than
quitting.
#
COMPACT
If you have a small display you might want to use this command. It turns off
(or on) the extra newline after output to your screen.

AREA AREAS WORLD WORLDS
Warning: the suggested levels are just that, suggestions.  Obviously
your chances of survival depend on the caliber of your group, how much
armor you have, whether you have a client program with auto recall,

we have mobs.  :)

#
GO GOTO

By using this command, immortals can quickly go to a particular player,
mobile or room number.

Example:

> goto Tara
> goto yevaud
> goto 1200

See Also: TRANSFER
#
TRANSFER

This command allows gods to bring a character or mobile to them without
using summon.  It is best to let a player know that you will be transferring
a player before you actually do it.  This can also be used to transfer
players from room to room on the MUD.

Example:

> transfer Mattick 
(transfers Mattick to your location)

> at 3001 transfer Mattick 
(transfers Mattick to room 3001)

> at mayor transfer Mattick
(transfers Mattick to the room in which the Mayor is located)
#
SOCKETS  

This command will allow you to see who is logged into the game, and from
what machines they are logged in.
#
SWITCH

This command allows immortals to "take over" the bodies of mobiles within
the game.  This is especially useful when roleplaying during quests.  To
leave the body of the mobile and return to your original form, type <return>.
#
SNOOP

This immortal command allows you to surreptitiously observe the actions
of players within the game.  This command is designed to aid in the
discipline of players and is NOT to be used for the purposes of harrassment
or voyeurism.  Please be considerate of other players when exercising the
privilege of the snoop command.

To snoop a player type snoop <playername>.  To snoop yourself type snoop
<your name>.
#
ECHO GECHO

Both of these commands display a line of text to other characters.  Echo
displays it to all people in the same room (or another room if at is used),
gecho displays it to everyone.  Use with caution.
#
SACRIFICE TAP JUNK

If you want to get rid of a corpse or an item, type sac <item name|corpse>.
This rids the game of unecessary clutter and helps keep the screen scroll
for other players to a minimum.  Typing tap <item name|corpse> will achieve
the same results as sac.  Both of these commands replace the junk command.

Please be sure to sacrifice your corpses when you are done with them, 
ESPECIALLY corpses of mobiles that have a lot of equipment on them (Such
as the cityguards).           
#
NEWBIE

Welcome to Rivers of MUD!

As a new player, the first thing you will want to do is go up from the
Temple and go through Mud School.  Doing so will help you get some decent
equipment to start playing with as well as some experience.  Be sure to
read the signs in Mud School, and don't drop out!

We don't allow playerkilling or playerstealing on Rivers of MUD, so please
behave accordingly.

Your first action should be to type 'commands', to see all the wonderful 
commands you can use.

The following help entries are of special interest to new players:
CHANNELS SCORE PRACTICE TRAIN SACRIFICE SHOPS NEWS RENT USELESS
#
ASSIST

The assist command is used to help another character in command -- it attacks
the person he is fighting.  Assisting yourself  displays a request for
assistance (whether or not you are fighting).  You can not assist against
a player, or assist someone who is not fighting.

Syntax:

assist <character>: Help that character in combat
assist <your name>: Display a neat message asking for help.
#
DISCONNECT DISC

The Disconnect command closes a socket.  This is particularly useful for
hard-to-type names and/or characters who lost link before actually entering
the game.  To use it, type disconnect <socket>, where socket is the number
listed in front of their name by the sockets command.
#
QUIET

The quiet command turns off most forms of communication.  With it on, you will
not hear gossips, shouts, or most tells.  You WILL still hear says, emotes, and
tells from immortals.
#
DEAF

The deaf commands renders you unable to hear shouts.  Unlike a divine NOSHOUT,
deaf may be turned on or off at will.
#
COMMANDS COMMAND  Unlike a divine NOSHOUT,
deaf may be turned on or off at will.
#
COMMANDS COMMAND

Lists all the (non-divine) commands available to you.  Very useful for new
players, and for seeing if anything new has been added.  Socials are not
included at this time.
#
CHAIN "CHAIN LIGHTNING"

This is an area-effect mage spells, which arc from monster to monster until it 
runs out of power. Be wary using is, however -- it can be lethal to the caster
as well.
#
CALM

This cleric spell stops all fighting in a room.  The more monsters in the room,
and the more powerful the enemies, the less likely it is to suceed.
#
HASTE

Usage       : cast 'haste' [target]
Accumulative: no
Duration    : Level / 2 hours (self) or / 4 hours (others)

This potent combat spells gives the recipient additional attacks in combat, as
well as improving reflexes.  Beware, however, for hasted adventurers need to
eat twice as much to sustain their bodies, and the powerful magics make 
healing difficult.
#
FRENZY

Usage       : cast 'frenzy' [target]
Accumulative: no
Duration    : Level / 3 hours

Using this spell fills the recipient with divine anger and rage, greatly 
increasing his ability to hit and inflict damage in combat.  However, such
enraged warriors are often much easier to hit.  Frenzy may only be used on on
characters of your alignment.
