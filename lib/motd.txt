* ROM II

  Rivers of Mud will be switching to a Merc 2.0 base on August 31st.  All old
  playerfiles will be removed at this point (immortals will receive some levels
  on the new mud, but not immortality).  You can get a head start on this 
  switch by playing on the test port, cie-2.uoregon.edu 4000.

* Notify rtaylor@cie.uoregon.edu if there are any problems, or if you have
  any questions or suggestions.
