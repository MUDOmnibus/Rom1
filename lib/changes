Yeah, two known memory clobbers come to mind:

(1) In spec_ass.c, find and remove all the references to mobs that aren't
    in tinyworld.mob.  The easy way to do this is to add some trap code
    to read_mobile that reports the virtual number whenever it can't find
    it and is going to return -1.  That will remove assignments to
    mob_index[-1].spec_fun.

(2) In fread_string change 'pAlloc = ""' to 'pAlloc = str_dup( "" )'
    for the case where it reads a zero-length string.

Thanks for the code

Furey
