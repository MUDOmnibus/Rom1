YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE............

I am sorry to announce that due to load problems on the server for Rivers of
MUD, a decision was reached to close it down.  No plans are being made to find
a new site, or in any way reimburse losses.   I am sorry, but I found out when 
all the files were removed from my account.

Anyway, it has been fun.  I hope to see you all on other muds.
