darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.

Swiftest's Private Chambers~
From here, the sounds of the outside world die down to a murmur. You
feel at peace in this room. The furniture can only be described as
dreamy, as you see a white cloud--shaped like a very comfy sofa--float
lazily by. The soft light streams from above from a singular point and
spreads smoothly in distinct colorful rays dancing and mixing together.

Hi.  Welcome to Mud School.  If you are SURE you don't want to continue with
your training, just go back down.  If you want to continue, go north (type 
'north').  All the instructions in this school will be in the form of signs, 
so don't forget to read any of them!  
Now, for those who DO know how to play mud, go through mud school anyway, so
you can get our fabulous eq along the way.  Don't worry, this area is quite
short.
Finally, for those who just want to go to the Arena, it is south of you.

To start you off, here is some equipment.  On the floor should be a sword,
a dagger, a mace, and a vest and a shield.  To pick them off the floor, type
'get all'.  This allows you to pick up everything off the floor that you are
able to.  Now, to wear something, type wear <something>.  For example, you can
type 'wear vest' to wear the vest.  For convenience, you can type 'wear all'
to wear all that you can.  Conversely, for the case of picking things on the
floor, you can type 'get <something>' and you would pick that object up.
To wield a weapon, type 'wield <weapon>', i.e., <weapon> is the weapon you want
to wield.  If you are a thief, type 'wield dagger'.  If cleric, type 'wield
mace'.  If warrior or mage, type 'wield sword'.  Now, for the quiz.  You are
currently carrying more items than you need.  To see your list of inventory,
type 'inventory'.  Now, you don't need the other weapons.  Question, how do you
DROP the unnecessary items????  After you have finished this lesson, open the
door west by typing 'open door west' and go west.

Welcome to the next station.  Here, you will learn to go in all possible
locations.  As you've seen, some rooms don't lead back to where they arrived
from.  For example, if you were to go back east, you would not arrive to the
room where you got your nice weapons and armor.  Now, the directions you can
possible go to in any room are:  North, South, West, East, Up, and Down.  Of
course, some rooms don't have all those exits available.  To find out which
exits are obvious, type the word 'exits'.  This would tell you all the obvious
exits.  Now, there are times that some doors are closed or locked or secret.
Then, you would have to notice clues, or try going in that direction.  If
there is any type of door in that direction, it will tell you so.  So, try
going into all of the directions, but when you are done, go north from here,
open the door, and continue on.

Welcome to the next portion of Mud School.  Here, you will learn about combat.
Now, the first lesson about combat is to know who to fight.  To do this, you
can type 'consider <monster>', <monster> being the monster you want to con-
sider fighting.  Now, the messages you get when you consider them should be
obvious in meaning, so I won't explain them to you.  There is a monster in the
room down.  He is VERY powerful, and fighting him would be very hard.  Your
goal is to learn how to flee from him, not to fight him!  So when you go in,
type 'hit blob', since blob is his name.  But since you won't be able to defeat
him, type 'flee' to flee from him.  If you successfully flee from him, you stop
combat!  Okay, when you are ready, go down.
After you flee, you will be back in this room.  When you are ready to go on to
the next station, open door west, and go west.
Oh, get the lantern and hold it, by typing 'hold lantern'.

Welcome to the next station of Mud School.  Here, you will attack monsters of
all types.  In the north one, there is an aggressive monster.  That means that
he will attack you even if you don't initiate combat!  To the east is a regular
monster.  He won't attack unless you attack, and he won't flee for his life.
To the south is a wimpy monster.  He will try to flee if you hurt him too much.
To the west is an aggressive wimpy monster.  He will only initiate combat if
you are either sleeping or hurt badly.  Also, if he is hurt badly, he will
flee.  Now, since we are talking about sleeping, this is how you sleep.  You
type 'sleep'.  When you are sleep, you regenerate move, hit, and mana points
fastest.  However, you are not aware of your surroundings.  You can REST,
and that is better, since you are more aware, but you regenerate less than
sleeping.  Either way is faster than standing.  To wake up, just WAKE.  To
STAND, well, it should be obvious by now.  Now, after you kill the monsters,
look in their corpses.  Do this by either 'look in corpse' or 'examine corpse'.
Then, if you see something, type 'get <something> corpse' or, if you want to
get it all, 'get all corpse'.  You want to do that, since they usually hold
some good equipment.  Now, when you are done with all 4 monsters, go down to
the next station.  Remember, between combat, rest or sleep to recover lost
hit points and mana!

Welcome.  By now, you must be hungry and thirsty.  And, since you have accumu-
lated some money in your last battles.  (Hopefully, if not, it's not too late
to go back up there and killing the poor monsters.)  To the south is a store.
To see what there is to buy, type 'list' in that room.  To buy something, type
'buy <something>'  You can also possibly sell something.  To find, out, type
'value <something>', making sure that that <something> is in your inventory,
and not worn or wielded or in a bag.  Then, type 'sell <something>' to sell it.
Note that not all stores sell or buy at the same prices.  You would like to
buy in that store:  1 bag, 1 skin, and about 5 breads.  To save time with
typing, for bread, you can type 'buy bread', then at the next prompt, '!'.  The
'!' means to redo whatever you just typed in your last command.  So, okay, go
south and buy those things.  After that, you would like to EAT bread and DRINK
skins.  After that, put them in your bags by 'put <item> bag'.  You can also
TAKE items out in the same way.  To see what's in a bag, type 'examine bag', or
you can LOOK in the bag.
After that, FIND your next exit.  (try looking or bumping into directions)

north of here.  The monster holds the key.  After you do so, come back here,
and continue east to the next Station.  While you are here, you might want to
know about yourself, by typing SCORE, and by EXAMINEing yourself.  You can
see who else is on this mud by typing WHO.  Also, if you want to talk to them,
SHOUT so everyone can hear, or TELL <person>, which is a one to one communica-

Welcome!  You have passed to the last stage of Mud School, the graduation!
Take the diploma and the MERCENARY War Banner on the pedestal, and may it
help you in your quest for peace in this world!  Since you might still want to
practice your swordsmanship and such before going to the real world, you can go
NORTH to the ARENA, to battle our small monsters.  However, do NOT attack other
players.  Doing so will result in YOUR death, since we will seek you out and
kill you.  Since you are here, let's give you one last lesson.  Commands like
HELP, NEWS, CREDITS, and WIZLIST will probably give you more information about
this game, while INFO, IDEA, BUG, and TYPO help you give US information about
this game.  To know more about these, type 'help <command>', where <command> is
the command you want to know about.  Have fun!  And don't daudle here, since
I'm sure the next student will arrive soon, and I don't want you getting in
that student's way.  Now, run along and go to the arena north of here.

points you have, type 'train' while you are in this room.  To train for a 
specific attribute, type 'train <attr>' where attr is the first 3 letters of
the attribute you want increased.  It costs 3 practice to increase your prime
attribute (the one you started out with a 16) one point up, and 5 practices 
to increase any other attribute.  No attribute can be above 18.  Make sure you
save some practices, so you can practice skills and spells at Hatchet's Guild
Room east 2 rooms from you.

out what spells and skills you can practice and the available practices, type
'practice'.  Then, to practice the specific skill, type practice <skill>,
where skill is the skill or spell you wish to practice.  Practicing increases
the amount you know of that spell or skill, up to a certain maximum.  When
you have practiced all you wish to practice, go west twice to train your
attributes, or west and north to continue mudschool.  Remember, you need
practices to train for attribute increase also, so save some practices for 
that (don't use them all for skills and spells).

Entrance to the Shadow Grove~
  Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and

The audience chamber~
  You are in a large chamber. Small bolts of energy leap from wall to wall,
crackling with power. The floor is a swirl of indeterminable colors and
paterns ever changing. Bright bursts of color seem to explode into the air
and fade again at random times. All this splender plays about and draws
attention to a large throne in the center of the room, it seems to be cut
from a single enormous emerald.

A beam of light from the opening above you falls upon a message
that has been scrawled on the wall here, perhaps a very long time
ago.
The message reads:
     Adventure for the strong yet calculating
     Death for the weak and shallow
     Treasure for the smart and lucky
     Death for the stupid and acursed
An ancient Glyph above the entrance keeps monsters from
wandering up

  Different than the rest this place is fairly well kept...whoever destroyed
the other areas must have been disinterested in this area and so an altar
still stands here and the walls show some interesting scenes from the life
of Cristis the Kind...a ruler of the outlying regions around Midgaard many
years ago...
  The door to the north has been permanently jammed; the southern door seems to
have been ripped out of its hinges so there is nothing but an opening to the
south. The room slopes downward towards the north to a stone door.
The Ghost of Cristis the Kind stands here barely visible to the eye.
You sense he is trying to say something.

altar~
  This king must have been well loved. Great care was taken into the creation
of this altar. It stands only about 2 feet high with the remnants of candle-
wax on its top surface. It says in ancient tongue on its dusty top:
              "Praise the almighty Cristis the bringer of
                 good and justice to the world. He who
                fought the evilest finally is at peace
               may the Gods remember him forever..."
~
E
walls scenes~
  Beautiful and ancient...scenes of battles with horrid creatures of ugly
distortion...Cristis the Kind and his armies are shown here defeating the
evil armies of the past... You recognize a small painting of an ancient city
as being the older replica of Midgaard...it was much bigger then during the
greater times of the old Empire.
~

ghost cristis~
  Pathetic and ghastly he looks very sad...his rest has been disturbed by
the evil creatures that have invaded his domain and grave...He stands here
shimmeringly desolid and quite unable to effect the outside world or be
effect by the outside world...he is quite old, but very kind looking...
He holds up a tiny piece of parchment for all to read and look at with a
glimmer of tears in his eyes...
~
E
parchment~
  It says an aweful lot for its apperent size:
     "Hello stranger and last hope for Midgaard and this tomb!
   or just anyone who passes through my tomb.  This is a last plea
   for aid by a man long since dead from this Earth.  I have served
   all my life for the cause of good and hope for your help now
   that my time has passed.
     The forces of evil have taken control of this tomb and the great
   Kings of old need your aid to free us and deliver us to peace
   once again. I think that I alone have been able to make myself
   appear and manage to have the last acolyte here write this note,
   for I am unable to speak, or affect this dying world.
     These forces of evil plan to eventually take over Midgaard
   and the outlying reaches for their own! They MUST be stopped. No one
   knows how long this will take it could be days it could be months!
     Their leader goes by the name of Roch'tar, the reincarnated Vampire
   of a time somewhere after my death.  He is yet not able to enter
   this world presently but is somewhere still trapped here in these
   tombs.  You MUST stop him by sytematically destroying his minions
   and followers who he has created from the dead and called from the
   bowels of the earth!!!
     Thank you all who may endeaver to succeed and and may the Gods
   bless you on your Quest!"

 Two hints: in order to leave this place you must get the special
    rod from a hidden vault in a room down and to the east somewhere...
    this room will be a painted room as well...look vault and it will
    tell you what to do...the second hint is that I may appear elsewhere
    in the lower sections of the tombs for more help!

  Whomever built this place must have been very rich indeed!  Though
you did enter through a rather small door this place has enough room
to hold a several score of people.  The floor has a beautifully woven
carpet, and the walls are covered in finely crafted tapesties. You can
tell that these things must have been worth much but they have not lasted
well throughtout the ages. Massive doors lead off to the south and a small
door leads up above you only accessable via. a large stone staircase.

Its rather small and looks quite heavy but maybe with some kind of 'leverage'

  Red carpeting completely covers the floor. it seems untouched throughtout
the ages and has a large build up of dust. There are tracks leading up and

tapesties~
  The tapesties were woven into beautiful and exciting scenes of battles
long ago. One on the left your shows the historic battle between Jubal the
Benevolent and Hroth Kragen's forces that eventually Jubal's army won (of
course) and was responsible for the forming the city within which you now
reside.  Here was the most inportant stategic point in Jubal's supply-line
due to the how remote it is and of course it was (at that time) the last
major population and mercanile district before the sea...where of course
Hroth's forces were eventually driven and demolished.

  the letters say:

100 years ago. If not for him Midgaard of course would have eventually been
squashed by these monsters as well...luckily this was not the case. Tho it
is now appearent that a new threat has appeared to the city and this region.
Though Crotus was a goodly king, it was rumored that he turned to the dark ways
in his dying years...supposed he died an evil man...

Great Mitnar. Even today there exist cult worshipers of this long dead

odd about the floor tho...the western wall has a hole punched through it as

The lower chambers and tombs of the undead~
  The stench of death is heavy in here...you think you may get easily lost
in these caverns...But then again this place is quite different!
  The room has been totally hollowed out and smoothed...and a pit has
been drilled in the center of the floor (though nothing is in it).
  Also extensive gruesome paintings of beasts and monsters terrorizing the
country side; vampires sucking the blood of beasts and humans alike...
the scenes are horribly graphic.
The Ghost of Cristis is floating here...

ghost cristis~
  He looks alittle fainter and is holding up another parchment for you
to read...
~
E
parchment~
  Written on it he says :
      "Congratuations adventurer you made it this far! Now, in order
    to get out of here look at the vault hidden in the painting and
    get the key pry rod that will take you out...if you have passed
    through all of these monsters and abonimations with ease you are
    ready to continue. But if not the rod will help you get out.The
    Vault will clue you on what to open.
      There exists nearby a horrid beast called Snapper Joe...he is
    a reincarnated fiend called up directly from hell...he is tough
    but if you manage to kill him he has a key to the lower depths
    of these horrid tombs and catacombs. I cant promise you what lies
    ahead but it will promise to be challenging and hopefully will
    prove that we are nearing the end of the reign of the Horrid
    Roch'tar.
      If you need to rest and come back, take the rod. But remember to
    dump it so that others will have a chance at continuing here also.
      Thank you again brave fellows!"

The hills~
   You are surrounded by dark and sinister hills. Although they seemed fairly
small from a distance you now get the feeling that they're closing in on you,
towering over you, overwhelming you...
The small path seems to have second thoughts about these hills because it
starts winding unnecessarily, turning several times around itself.
To the south the hills have a lighter hue of dark. To the north however, the
hills have become nightblack holes in the distant mountains.

to the ground, only staying here because you're standing on it. with a slight
feeling of unease you look around noticing only a few bushes and a large sign
carved into the mountain.
You feel you can hear the cry of help from a thousand silent voices all coming
from an even darker hole in the mountain to the north marking the entrance to
a cave (or a grave :-).

The cave~
   You are in a large cave. The ceiling is lost somewhere above the reach of
your light. The floor, however, is highly illuminated, your light flickering
over several tombstones. Only one is whole, the rest have been shattered by
some savage blow. The remaining tombstone looks disturbingly new...
A small breeze of fresh air enters from the south (probably lost too). Take a
good breath, it may be your last mouthful of air in a long, long time that
others haven't breathed before you.
To the north a small tunnel continues into the mountain.

   You are walking in a narrow tunnel. The walls are only roughly shaped,
sharp rocks protruding everywhere, even from the floor making you stumble in
the flickering light. To the south the tunnel narrows even more making it
almost impossible to pass. To the north it slowly widens into a cave. There
is a branch of the tunnel going west.

tunately Arachnos is a baggy spider too, and webs all her treasures
to her beautiful silken body.

The Kitchen of Naris~
This must be the place of food and drink. You can hear the faint noise of 
rats feasting on meat and bread from somewhere undeterminable. The sound
makes you feel the agony of HUNGER. The only visible exit is south to the
Northern end of the hall. To the north there is a larder, and to the east
stands a fridge.

is ablaze within.  The bed is enormous, covering at least HALF of this great

from here. The wind pulls you from left to right and back. This seems like a

Otherwise you would risk death by falling to the hard ground below. DO NOT

to chuckle quietly, and as you descend further you hear a soft whisper
originating from within the Chain *ITSELF*. 
It says, " Welcome back some other time, stranger. Your company is always
           ... hmmm ... interesting. God Speed. "
The chain extends further down through the now spreading clouds.

   You are standing on a glass road, suspended from nothing some 300 
yds off the ground. The road leads to a wide square opening in the side
of a great, pale-blue inverted pyramid to the south. Some two yards
into the opening is a wide double door, made from metal. The road 
continues north, sweeping over the horizon.

The matrix fault~
   You are standing on the bottom of a wide crack in the matrix, going 
north and south. The sides of the fault are alive with writhing 
worm-like things, snaking out from the cracked glass, sparking madly.
To your west, a pile of great slabs of glass has fallen into a jumble 
beside the wall. They are much too large and sharp-edged for you to 
lose your precious fingers on! To the south, there is at least four 
yards between the furthest reaches of the worm-like strands, but to the

The dining hall~
   This is Dragons' dining hall. There is a large long solid oak table,
seating at least 24, with heavy, wooden chairs to match. The oak panel walls
are filled with paintings. There are doors to the north and east, and to the
west there is a wide double door opening out onto the sunlit terrace.

painting paintings~
There are many, many beautiful paintings of famous dragons of history and
literature. There is a big one of Smaug, a group picture of Cuspidorian Toxic
Dragons, a rather fearsome picture of norse Chaos incarnate, a grainy black-
and-white photograph of Vorgulremik the Steel Dragon, a romantic picture of 
Dalvenjah the Mindijaran and Allan the man become dragon. There are three
empty frames labeled 'The Chimerical', 'The Mythical' and 'The Hypothetical',
A panoramic picture of Strabo flying between the worlds dominate one wall, 
while a dragons-eye view of Pern (with dragons in the foreground, of course) 
fills another. There even are a few rare medieval renditions of the great 
beast of the Revelation. Over the head of the table hangs a rather modest 
portrait of a silver Dragon, sparkling with blue lightening, looking amused.

The terrace~
   You are standing on a sunlit terrace in front of Dragon's mansion. To the
west, there is a splendid view over the field down over the lake. To the north
is the greenhouse, its large windowpanes shimmering with weird and wonderful
colors, while a double door leads into the house proper to the east. It is
warm and calm here. There is a white-painted table with a parasol here,
together with a matched set of chairs.

the hallway north.

The Surf Shack~
   You are in a small, cozy little shack made of driftwood and bamboo shoots.
The floor is covered with a hand-woven rug, and sand and bits of wax are
strewn about it messily.  In one corner you can see a comfortable hammock,
swaying gently in the sea breeze.

rug~
The rug is painstakingly hand-woven from the finest fabrics.  It depicts a
school of five beautiful dolphins, swimming through a perfectly peeling
tubular wave of the deepest blue water.  It makes you long for the ocean...

hammock~
The hammock sways gently in the sea breeze coming in through the door and
the cracks in the walls.  It looks like the perfect place to crash after
a long session.

wax~
You see various small bits of wax mixed with sand on the floor.  The wax has
a pleasant coconut smell to it.

The Wooden Porch~
   You are standing on a hand-built wooden porch which overlooks the beach
and a beautiful point break to the south.  Several fiberglass surfboards
lean against the wall of the shack, and a couple of chairs stand here also,
suitable for viewing the lineup.  A cool offshore wind is gently blowing.

A full quiver of surfboards is leaning against the wall here, including
a classic Dewey Weber longboard, a hellman's gun, a nice tuberiding
pintail, and a brand-new Al Merrick squashtail thruster.

chair chairs~
A pair of wicker chairs, perfect to sit and catch rays or to watch the
perfect right peelers off the point.

beach~
The beach is pure white sand, leading out to a rocky point off which
perfectly glassy right tubes are breaking.  Sheer heaven.

wave waves ocean point~
Conditions couldn't be better today.  Light offshore winds coupled with a
nice swell are resulting in long hollow tubular rights that peel for
hundreds of yards.  The only people out right now are a pair of dolphins
frolicking in the perfect peelers.

Asgard~
   You stand on a huge expanse of glass. Below you is the universe, in its
ever-fluctuating state.  You stand in Asgard, home of the gods, frozen in
its unchanging state.  A huge Mansion lies to the east.

Valhalla~
  This is the huge Hall of Valhalla, where the Gods rule supreme.  The
cavernous building stretches infinitely in all directions except up,
which returns you to Asgard, and down, which takes you to the Market Square.

My Antarctica~
All around you is a cold, desolate wasteland of ice and snow.  The glare
from the ice blurs the horizon, causing the land and sky to melt into
a vague lonely white haze that surrounds and smothers you.  A bitter,
freezing chill gnaws at your very bones.

Ezra's Sexual Torture Chamber~
This room's reputation does little to complement its actual appearance.
Your feet sink into a thick, blood-red carpet.  Black drapes tied by silver
cords hang on the walls.  Scented candles burn from silver candelabras set
in the corners, giving the room a warm glow.  Large, puffy cushions are
strewn about the room.  They look quite comfortable.

Walking on the Moon~
The proud and lonely silence of Mare Imbrium surrounds you, as you gaze upon 
the sterile splendor of the moon.  All around is the velvet curtain of night, 
studded with a thousand gleaming jewels.  Below you hangs the beautiful 
fields of Earth, looking fragile and far away, but full of hope.  A sense of
wistful regret touches you, as you think about what might have been, and what
will be.

A small shipping tag is pinned to the ground with a worn hunting knife.  
Upon it is a dedication to Robert Anson Heinlein, the father of the future.

Liselle's Private Heaven~
You find yourself walking the sea shore at sunset.  Soft, soothing mist curls
contentedly around your ankles.  A cool salt breeze lifts your hair and 
pastes tendrils of hair to your cheeks.  The sounds of the water pound and
roar in your ears.  Waves rise up and break in front of you, their foam gently
tugging at you, tempting you, begging you to walk out into their depths.
Someone has written in the sand the words, "We love you Lisa" and placed
delicate pink sea shells all around.
